# fonera-i2c

La Fonera is a small router with wireless functions created by FON.

La Fonera's firmware can easily be replaced by OpenWrt? which provides any required elements to enable I2C bus usage. This feature allow us to use La Fonera to drive I2C devices like eeproms, temperature sensors, etc.

If you want to add I2C bus(es) to La Fonera, a wiki page have been made to help you.
